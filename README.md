**Overview**

This project aims to build a machine-learning model that can predict revenue values for different revenue categories in a given year for Revenue Services Lesotho. The model is developed using XGBoost, a powerful gradient-boosting library, to achieve accurate predictions.

**Project Structure**

Data: Contains dataset Data RSL.csv containing the revenue data, the dataset is used to train the model.
Notebooks: Includes Revenue Services Lesotho Tax Prediction.ipynb, a Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing and model training code.
Models: Contains the trained XGBoost model RSL_Model.model saved as model file.
