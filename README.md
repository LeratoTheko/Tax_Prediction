**Overview**

This project aims to build a machine-learning model that can predict revenue values for different revenue categories in a given year for Revenue Services Lesotho. The model is developed using XGBoost, a powerful gradient-boosting library, to achieve accurate predictions.

**Project Objective**

The main objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can assist Revenue Services Lesotho in forecasting revenue values for various categories (e.g., taxes, duties, fees) in a specific year. By accurately predicting revenue, the organization can better plan its budget, allocate resources effectively, and optimize revenue collection strategies.

**Project Structure**

Data: Contains dataset Data RSL.csv containing the revenue data, the dataset is used to train the model.

Notebooks: Includes Revenue Services Lesotho Tax Prediction.ipynb, a Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing and model training code.

Models: Contains the trained XGBoost model RSL_Model.model saved as model file.
